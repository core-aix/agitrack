# aGiT

aGiT stands for agent + git. It is an interactive Python CLI that wraps coding-agent command line tools and Git so agentic code changes are committed with traceable metadata.

The MVP supports OpenCode as the first backend.

## Usage

Run in the current repository:

```bash
agit
```

Run against another repository:

```bash
agit --repo /path/to/repo
```

Inside the interactive CLI, plain text is sent to the active agent backend:

```text
aGiT(opencode)> fix the parser bug
```

Slash commands:

```text
/help              show commands
/status            show git status
/user-commit       create a <user> commit
/stage             review and stage untracked files
/unstaged          show intentionally unstaged files
/model <model>     set the backend model
/agent opencode    select the OpenCode backend
/exit              exit
```

## Commit Behavior

- Tracked modifications and deletions are staged with `git add -u`.
- New untracked files require confirmation before staging.
- Declined untracked files are remembered in repository-local `.agit/state.json`.
- Agent commits use the `<agent>` tag and include the full interaction trace since the last code-changing commit.
- User commits use the `<user>` tag and include aGiT metadata.
- Commits are created only when staged changes exist.
