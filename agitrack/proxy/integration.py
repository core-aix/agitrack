"""Branch/merge/integration policy for aGiTrack worktree sessions (#29, P5).

:class:`IntegrationService` encapsulates the git operations that manage the
lifecycle of session turn branches and their integration into the base branch.
It is deliberately UI-free: every method returns a plain outcome (a string or
dataclass) and the ProxyRunner renders messages / popups in response.

The service takes all its inputs as explicit parameters (``base_repo``,
``base_branch``, per-call ``repo`` / ``name`` / ``worktree``) so it is safe
to call from inside temp-swap windows — it never reads ``runner.active``
implicitly.

Merge-context state machine
---------------------------

The production code uses at most **one** active merge resolution at a time per
session (the ``merge_ctx`` field on a ``Session`` object).  The abandoned
:mod:`agit.merge_queue` module modelled a *queue* of pending merges serialised
through a MergeCoordinator — a design that does not map onto the existing
single-resolution-at-a-time flow:

* MergeCoordinator queues sessions and processes them one at a time, while the
  production code resolves each session's merge independently and concurrently
  (background sessions are serviced via ``_with_session`` from the event loop).
* The ``prompt_sent_at`` timing in the production flow (an Enter keystroke
  arrives asynchronously after the text is injected) has no counterpart in the
  MergeParticipant protocol.
* Adopting the queue model would change *when* merges start and finalize, which
  is an observable behavior change outside the allowed scope (P5 only permits
  formalising the state machine).

Decision: ``agit/merge_queue.py`` and its tests are deleted. Instead, the
ad-hoc ``merge_ctx`` dict is replaced here by a :class:`MergeContext`
dataclass with an explicit :class:`MergePhase` enum, preserving all existing
timing semantics byte-for-byte.
