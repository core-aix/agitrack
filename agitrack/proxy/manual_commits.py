"""Manual-commit mode and latent tracking, as a mixin on ``ProxyRunner``.

``--manual-commits`` inverts aGiTrack's usual bargain: the agent's work is recorded as
HIDDEN latent commits on a side ref, the working tree is left deliberately dirty, and the
user commits on their own schedule — at which point a hook folds the accumulated tracking
into their commit message. The same machinery backs every no-worktree mode, where the fold
happens automatically.

It is a strict addition: none of it runs unless the mode is on, which is why it reads as a
self-contained layer rather than a branch inside the normal commit path.

See ``sharing.py``'s header for why these are mixins rather than collaborator objects.
