"""BackendProcess: child-process / PTY lifecycle for the proxy backend (#29, P2).

Owns the fork/exec mechanics, PTY drain, window-size ioctl, signal-based
teardown, and all writes to the child's PTY.  Policy decisions (command
construction, sandbox wrapping, session selection) stay in ProxyRunner.

Ownership note (P3)
-------------------
Each proxy :class:`~agitrack.proxy.session.Session` owns one BackendProcess
instance (``session.process``) for its whole lifetime.  ``child_pid`` and
``master_fd`` remain addressable as plain fields — on the Session via
properties over its process, and on the runner via the P3 compat properties
that delegate to the active session — so tests built via
``ProxyRunner.__new__`` that set/read these fields directly keep working.
