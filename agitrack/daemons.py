"""Global registry of the long-running aGiTrack daemons, across every repository.

aGiTrack can leave three kinds of detached process running: the **repo dashboard** (`-d`), the
**backtrace dashboard** (`--backtrace`), and the **background tracker** (`-b`). Each lives in its
own repo/temp dir, so there was no single place to see (or stop) them all. Every daemon now writes
a tiny ``<pid>.json`` into a shared directory when it starts serving and removes it when it exits;
this module reads that directory to:

* list every running daemon with its function, repo, and PID (`agitrack --daemons`), so a user can
  kill a stray one by hand; and
* after a self-update, gracefully stop and re-spawn them all so they reload the new version
  (:func:`restart_all`, called from the update restart path).

Entries whose process is gone are pruned on read, so a crashed daemon never lingers in the list.
