"""Self-updater for aGiTrack.

aGiTrack can update itself in place. Two installation shapes are supported:

* **source-linked** — aGiTrack is importable from a git checkout of its own source
  (the documented ``pip install -e .`` editable install). Updates merge the
  upstream branch into the checkout: a clean checkout fast-forwards, and a
  checkout carrying the user's own commits (aGiTrack runs on session worktree
  branches that accumulate commits) gets a normal merge. Only a genuine content
  conflict, or an uncommitted (dirty) tree, blocks the update — with a message
  instead of leaving the running source half-merged.
* **package** — aGiTrack was installed as a wheel (e.g. ``pip install agitrack``,
  ``pipx install agitrack``, or a Homebrew formula). The latest available version is
  discovered with ``pip index versions``. The upgrade itself is, by preference,
  **package-manager-independent**: it runs the *running interpreter's own* pip
  (``<python> -m pip install --upgrade``), which upgrades a plain pip install, a venv,
  a ``--user`` install, and a pipx venv identically — no need to detect or shell out to
  pipx/brew/apt. It falls back to a ``pip3``/``pip`` on ``PATH`` only when that
  interpreter has no ``pip`` module. The one situation pip can't handle is an
  externally-managed (PEP 668) Python — Homebrew's or a distro's, where pip refuses to
  write; there aGiTrack defers to the owning manager (``brew upgrade`` when the install
  is under Homebrew, the only system manager that ships aGiTrack), and otherwise reports
  a full enumeration of every manual upgrade route.

The checking logic here is intentionally pure/blocking; callers (the CLI at
startup, the proxy runner's idle loop) run :meth:`Updater.check` in a background
thread so the terminal never stalls on a network ``git fetch``.
