# --- short-lived read cache -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: A SINGLE ENTER COSTS 19 GIT SUBPROCESSES, and five of them ask the same
# question. Measured through the real reactor on native Windows, on an empty repo with a clean
# tree: `rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` five times, `diff --quiet` three times, `diff --cached
# --quiet` three times, `ls-files --others` three times — 740 ms, which was 100% of the delay
# between pressing Enter and the prompt reaching the backend. Nothing was slow; there were just
# a lot of process spawns, and a process spawn costs ~38 ms on Windows against ~5 ms on
# macOS/Linux. That is the whole reason "Enter takes a long time" is a Windows report: the same
# path costs about 120 ms there and passes for instant.
#
# The submit path asks its questions through half a dozen collaborating helpers
# (`_pre_agent_commit_if_needed`, `has_pre_agent_user_changes`, `_base_user_edits_pending`,
# `_begin_agent_turn`, `_integrate_committed_turn_before_new_turn`, `_ensure_turn_branch`), and
# threading one answer through all of them would couple every one of them to the caller. So the
# de-duplication lives at the single choke point every one of them goes through instead.
#
# WHAT MAKES IT SAFE:
#   * It is OFF unless a caller explicitly opens a `read_cache()` scope, and those scopes are
#     milliseconds long. Nothing outside one ever sees a cached answer.
#   * Only unambiguously read-only plumbing is cached (below). Anything else — every commit,
#     stage, switch, merge, fetch — DROPS the whole cache as it runs, so a read that follows a
#     write in the same scope always re-runs. That is the invariant the callers depend on:
#     `_offer_pre_agent_user_commit` commits, and everything after it must see the new tree.
#   * It is THREAD-LOCAL, but invalidation is PROCESS-WIDE. The git worker thread commits and
#     merges on the very repos the reactor is reading, and a thread-local clear could never see
#     that. So every write anywhere in the process bumps a counter, and a cached answer is only
#     reused while that counter is unchanged — which makes "the worker committed while the
#     submit path was mid-flight" a cache miss rather than a stale answer.

        ``git merge main`` fast-forward, a pull, or a PR merged on GitHub drops commits
        between the cover anchor and HEAD that the agent never made; covering those
        misattributes other people's work (a release PR once landed in covered_commits).

        The reflog answers this exactly: it records HOW the ref moved, so a commit
        created here has a ``commit:`` entry naming it, while one that arrived shows up
        only under ``merge``/``pull``/``reset``. When no reflog is available (a fresh
        clone, an expired entry) fall back to the committer identity — GitHub, a CI bot
        or a teammate cannot be the agent running in this repository.

        #
        #  1. STALE COMMIT-GRAPH. gc writes a commit-graph; a later repack moves the objects
        #     it indexes, so the graph's position lookups no longer match the store and a walk
        #     aborts NON-ZERO -- "commit <sha> exists in commit-graph but not in the object
        #     database" -- though the object is present.
        #  2. LAZY (PROMISOR) FETCH on a partial/blobless clone (``git clone --filter=blob:none``).
        #     When a walk momentarily can't find an object locally -- e.g. mid-repack, when the
        #     pack set is being rewritten -- git tries to LAZY-FETCH it from the promisor remote.
        #     For aGiTrack's own local-only commits (turn branches, cover/shared-session objects)
        #     the remote answers "not our ref" and the read aborts ("Could not read <oid>;
        #     Failed to traverse parents"), even though the object is in the local store. The
        #     count then flaps (e.g. 485 one read, 289 the next) and the dashboard shows a
        #     truncated -- or empty -- log. Small/idle repos never gc enough to hit either.
        #
        # Every read passes check=False, so the aborted/partial output is used as-is. Disabling
        # the commit-graph makes git walk the store directly; disabling lazy fetch makes a walk
        # use the LOCAL objects (all present) instead of attempting a doomed network fetch. Both
        # are correct and negligibly slower at the sizes aGiTrack tracks. Lazy fetch is left ON
        # for reads that need file CONTENT (``--numstat`` line counts, ``-p``/``--stat`` diffs)
        # UNLESS the caller passes ``allow_lazy_fetch=False``: on a blobless clone such a read
        # legitimately fetches absent blobs, so suppressing it would zero the numbers -- but the
        # caller may *want* that. The dashboard's full-history numstat scan opts out, because
        # fetching every historical blob on every poll makes a big blobless clone's dashboard
        # hang for tens of seconds (and the interrupted fetches litter ``.git`` with tmp packs);
        # it instead counts from the LOCAL blobs and fetches only the page actually displayed.
        #
        # Lazy fetch is suppressed via the GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH=1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE, not the
        # ``-c fetch.disableLazyFetch=true`` config: measured on git 2.50.1 (Apple), the config
