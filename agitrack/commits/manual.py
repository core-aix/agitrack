"""Manual-commit latent tracking, extracted so any driver — the interactive proxy or the
headless background tracker — can record agent turns as hidden latent commits and fold them
into the user's own commit.

In manual-commit mode the agent edits the current branch directly (no worktree) and each turn
is recorded as a hidden "latent" commit on ``refs/agitrack/manual/<session_id>`` instead of
landing on the branch. HEAD never moves. When the user commits (via aGiTrack or an external
``git commit``), a ``prepare-commit-msg`` hook folds the pending turns' trace + metadata into
that ONE commit and a ``post-commit`` hook resets the latent ref. When a custom
``core.hooksPath`` makes the hooks impossible, a poll-and-cover fallback detects the commit and
adds a metadata-only cover commit instead.

This class owns exactly that machinery over a pair of GitRepo handles (the working ``repo`` and
the ``base_repo`` whose ``.agitrack/`` holds the durable hook files), plus the small amount of
mutable poll state it needs. It performs no I/O with the user; callers supply a ``debug`` sink.

    """Drop latent turns from ABANDONED sessions that no longer explain any uncommitted work.

    Manual mode is always no-worktree, so every session edits the SAME working tree, and a user
    commit folds the pending turns of all of them. That is right while those turns still explain
    the code being committed — and wrong once they don't. A session abandoned mid-work (a crash,
    Ctrl-C, a mode switch), or one whose edits the user discarded with ``git checkout --``, leaves
    a ref behind that nothing ever revisits: `reset_stale_ref` only ever looks at the caller's OWN
    ref. Its turns then ride into some later, unrelated commit, permanently attributing AI
    authorship and token counts to code that never contained them.

    The rule, per the maintainer:

        keep a session's turns when it made code changes that are still uncommitted — those get
        committed along with their trace; discard a trailing run of turns that led to no code
        change at all.

    Both halves are decided from git, not from a clock:

    * **Nothing uncommitted anywhere** (the working tree matches HEAD) — no session's changes
      survive, so every abandoned chain is discarded outright. This is the discarded-edit case.
    * **Something uncommitted** — the chain is kept, minus any TRAILING commits whose recorded
      tree matches HEAD's. Those are the conversation-only tail: turns that discussed rather than
      changed anything, so they contribute nothing to the commit about to be made.

    The caller's own ref is never touched — a live session owns its chain, and `reset_stale_ref`
    already governs it. Returns the refs that were changed (pruned or reset), for logging.
