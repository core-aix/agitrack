"""HTTP server for the live aGiTrack dashboard (#54).

`agitrack --dashboard` serves the HTML dashboard and opens it in the browser.
The page polls ``/data`` on an interval and re-renders, so the dashboard
reflects new commits as they land — useful for watching an agent work.
Everything derives from ``git log``: read-only, no state, identical on every clone. The
built view is cached per REF STATE (branch tip plus the latent manual refs), so a poll, a
log page or a return from /story or /learn reuses it instead of walking the history again;
a moved ref rebuilds it.

Where it binds depends on where aGiTrack is running. On your own machine it
stays on loopback; in a **remote shell** (SSH/Mosh) loopback would be reachable
only from the remote box itself, so it binds all interfaces instead and
advertises the remote's own IP — open it directly if the firewall allows, or
copy-paste the printed `ssh -L` command if it doesn't. Set
``AGITRACK_DASHBOARD_HOST`` to pin a bind address (``127.0.0.1`` opts back out).
