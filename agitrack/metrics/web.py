"""HTML dashboard for `agitrack --dashboard` (#54).

The page renders from two server endpoints so the browser never holds the whole
history — memory stays bounded no matter how big the repo is:

* :func:`aggregates_payload` (served at ``/data?<filters>``) computes every
  metric panel (coverage, tracked-AI vs non-tracked lines, tokens, per-backend/
  model/committer breakdowns, loop detection) over the filtered commits and
  returns just the numbers — no per-commit list.
* :func:`log_page` (served at ``/log?<filters>&offset=&limit=``) returns one
  page of the commit log; only that page carries the heavy message / trace /
  squash constituents.

:func:`format_html` embeds an initial aggregates payload plus the first log page
for an instant first paint, then the JS fetches ``/data`` and ``/log`` as the
filters change and the user pages through the log. Everything is computed from
``git log`` (+ ``gh`` for GitHub IDs when present), so the numbers are identical
on every clone. The visual language matches docs/index.html: a CRT/phosphor
terminal.

:func:`dashboard_data` (the full per-commit serialization) is retained for tests
and ad-hoc use; the live page does not embed it.

/* Every top-of-page notice lives in ONE sticky strip so they STACK instead of covering each
   other. They used to position themselves independently — the offline banner `fixed` at z-40,
   the backtrace/update banners `sticky` at z-60 — so on a backtrace dashboard the higher banner
   painted straight over "can't reach the server", hiding it at the one moment it matters most.
   (Two sticky banners at top:0 likewise converged onto each other once the page was scrolled.)
   Inside the strip the children are back in normal flow, so they stack top to bottom in DOM
   order, a hidden one takes no space, and each one's downward shadow is covered by the sibling
   below it — only the last visible banner casts onto the page. */
