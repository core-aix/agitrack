"""Run the metrics dashboard server in its own background process (#110).

`agitrack -d` used to serve the dashboard in the *foreground*, tying up the
terminal until Ctrl-C. Now it spawns the HTTP server as a detached background
process and returns to the shell prompt — you keep using the terminal while the
dashboard keeps serving. Recomputing metrics from ``git log`` on every poll is
real CPU/IO, so hosting it out-of-process also keeps that work (and its energy
use) off whatever launched it.

The daemon is **free-standing**: it survives the launching terminal (and the TUI,
for the Ctrl-G dashboard) and keeps serving until stopped explicitly with
``agitrack -d stop`` — or until it restarts itself after an aGiTrack update
(spawn-and-verify handoff in ``run_dashboard_daemon``). An optional *owner* pid
watchdog remains for callers that want a bound daemon (``_watch_owner``).

The child publishes a small handshake file (``<repo>/.agitrack/dashboard.json``)
recording the port it actually bound, so the launcher can show the URL and open a
browser without racing the child's startup.
