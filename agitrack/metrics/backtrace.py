"""``agitrack --backtrace``: reconstruct how PAST coding-agent conversations changed a
directory, from local transcripts alone — no git history, and no prior aGiTrack use.

The dashboard is normally computed from ``git log`` (aGiTrack's own commit metadata).
Backtrace instead reads the local session transcripts of every supported backend for the current
directory, recovers each turn's file edits from the tool-call inputs, and maps every turn
onto the SAME :class:`~agitrack.metrics.collect.Dashboard` / :class:`CommitStat` model the
web dashboard already renders. So a first-time user — even in a folder that was never a git
repo — can immediately see the value: every prompt, the model that answered it, the tokens
it burned, the lines it changed, and the full user↔agent trace behind each change.

It is a HISTORICAL RECONSTRUCTION, made explicit by a banner in the view, and is built
ONCE and cached: re-exporting transcripts on every dashboard poll (OpenCode's export shells
out to its CLI) would be far too slow, and the history does not change under us.

# 1. A stat-only signature of the transcripts (mtime+size of each session, mtime of the
#    directories that would hold a NEW one). Taken every _WATCH_POLL_SECONDS; when it is
#    unchanged — the overwhelmingly common case — the poll costs a handful of stat() calls
#    and nothing else happens.
# 2. Only when a DIRECTORY changed can a session have appeared or vanished, so only then is
#    discovery re-run. A signature change confined to known files skips it entirely.
# 3. The rebuild reuses the processed result of every session whose file is byte-identical
#    to the last pass, so an active conversation re-processes exactly one session.

# _WATCH_MIN_REBUILD_SECONDS then floors how often a rebuild may happen at all: while an
