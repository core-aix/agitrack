"""One dashboard, one port, every repository — switched by URL path.

Each repository used to get its own dashboard daemon on its own port, and each *view* of it got
another: the live dashboard on 8765, its backtrace on 8766, the next project on 8767, and so on
upward. That is a port to remember per project, a separate `ssh -L` line for each, a bookmark that
goes stale the moment the daemons come up in a different order, and no way at all to get from one
project's dashboard to another's except by finding the terminal you started it from.

So there is one hub instead. It binds a single port and mounts every repository under a path:

    /                     the repository you used last, in the view that fits it
    /r/<slug>/            a repository's LIVE dashboard (aGiTrack's own tracking)
    /b/<slug>/            the same repository's BACKTRACE (reconstructed from transcripts)
    /repos                what the repo switcher in the page header is built from

``<slug>`` comes from :func:`agitrack.repos.slug_for`, so it is derived from the path rather than
handed out: every process computes the same URL for the same repository without asking the hub.

The trailing slash on a mount is load-bearing. Every page fetches its data with RELATIVE URLs
(``data``, ``log``, ``learn/state``), which is what lets the exact same page code serve from the
root of a standalone daemon and from a mount point here; ``/r/<slug>`` without the slash would
resolve them against ``/r/``. Requests that arrive without it are redirected rather than fixed up,
so the browser's address bar and the page's own relative links never disagree.

Scopes are built lazily and kept: mounting a repository costs nothing until someone looks at it,
and a backtrace reconstruction (the expensive one) is built on first request into that view.

    0. **Starting a tracking mode shows the tracking.** `agitrack -b` and `agitrack -i` are the

       not that: it is the inferred history of what happened BEFORE. A remembered preference for
       the backtrace was still winning here, so starting a tracker on a fully tracked repository
       opened the one view that could not show the work about to be recorded. Asking for the
       reconstruction has its own command, `--backtrace`. The rules below still apply when there
       is nothing tracked yet, so a first-ever run on an old project still gets its history.
    1. A repository with **nothing tracked** but reconstructable sessions opens on the BACKTRACE.
       An empty live dashboard is the worst possible answer when the history is sitting in the
       backends' own transcripts.
    2. The **first time** it does have tracked commits carrying token counts, it flips to the live
       dashboard, once. That transition is the moment the recorded history becomes better than the
       inferred one, and it is worth showing unasked — but only the once, which is what
       ``tracked_seen`` in the repo registry remembers.
    3. After that, whatever view the user last chose stands. Toggling views is a decision, and a
       page that keeps overriding it is a page arguing with its reader.

    aGiTrack is demonstrably tracking must never be missing from the switcher — and it was.
    `repos.remember` was reachable only through `ensure_hub_for`, so a tracker that opened no

    A repo found only by its daemon is REMEMBERED as it is added, so the repair happens once and

    view the user last chose. Writes only on the first sighting, so the polling this endpoint
