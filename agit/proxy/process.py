"""BackendProcess: child-process / PTY lifecycle for the proxy backend (#29, P2).

Owns the fork/exec mechanics, PTY drain, window-size ioctl, signal-based
teardown, and all writes to the child's PTY.  Policy decisions (command
construction, sandbox wrapping, session selection) stay in ProxyRunner.

Compatibility note
------------------
``session_runtime.py`` swaps ``child_pid`` and ``master_fd`` per session, and
tests built via ``ProxyRunner.__new__`` set/read these fields directly on the
runner.  To keep that working without any change to call-sites, the runner
continues to own ``child_pid`` and ``master_fd`` as plain attributes; it passes
them to ``BackendProcess`` at construction time and reads them back after a
spawn.  BackendProcess is therefore a *thin mechanic owner*: it receives the
fd/pid pair, provides the operational methods, but does NOT hold a separate
independent copy of those values.  The runner remains the single source of
truth for ``child_pid`` / ``master_fd``, and session capture/restore continues
to work unchanged.
