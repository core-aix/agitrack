"""CommitEngine: the agent-commit pipeline extracted from ProxyRunner (#29, P4).

This module owns the stateless core of every agent-commit path:

* :meth:`CommitEngine.commit_turns` — trace-rebuild, token-accounting, commit-
  message assembly and ``git commit``.  Callers inject the two interactive
  behaviour differences as small callables so ONE implementation serves all
  three modes:

  - **proxy interactive** (ProxyRunner, popup UI):
      ``stage_untracked_fn = runner._review_untracked_popup``
      ``pre_commit_fn      = runner._ensure_turn_branch``
      ``on_commit_fn       = lambda sha: runner._set_message(...)``

  - **proxy exit / background** (non-interactive):
      ``stage_untracked_fn`` = auto-stage-non-declined closure
      (no ``pre_commit_fn``, no ``on_commit_fn``)

  - **actions / shell** (``AgitActions.create_agent_commit_from_turns``):
      ``stage_untracked_fn`` = ``actions.review_untracked(...)``
      (no ``pre_commit_fn``, no ``on_commit_fn``) — caller prints its own
      confirmation.

* :meth:`CommitEngine.finish_parse_if_ready` — awaited-followup logic and
  turn-completeness gate, extracted from
  ``ProxyRunner._finish_agent_parse_if_ready``.

* :meth:`CommitEngine.start_parse` — parse-worker launcher extracted from
  ``ProxyRunner._start_agent_parse``.  Results are always written back to the
  *owning* :class:`~agit.proxy.session.Session` (issue #15 fix, preserved
  verbatim).

* :meth:`CommitEngine.record_user_prompt` /
  :meth:`CommitEngine.await_followup` — thin state helpers.

* :meth:`CommitEngine.sanitize_state_trace` /
  :meth:`CommitEngine.initialize_session_baseline` /
  :meth:`CommitEngine.recover_nonempty_session` — session-startup helpers.

Design constraints
------------------
Every method that operates on git/state takes the *session bundle*
``(repo, state)`` (or a full :class:`~agit.proxy.session.Session`) explicitly
rather than touching ``self.active`` on the runner.  That makes it safe to
call from inside temp-swap windows (``_with_session``, ``_pump_background``,
``_stop_session``, ``_finalize_pending_work``) where ``active`` points at a
SERVICED session that may differ from the UI session.

What stays on ProxyRunner (not extracted here)
----------------------------------------------
* Debounce/status bookkeeping inside ``_maybe_agent_commit`` (uses
  runner-level ``file_change_event``, ``last_status``, ``last_poll``, …).
* ``_commit_latest_turn_sync`` and ``_finalize_pending_work`` (orchestrate the
  sync/exit flow over multiple sessions — runner scope).
* ``_commit_available_agent_turns`` (thin two-liner).
* ``_agent_commit_message`` (formats the UI popup text from
  ``_last_agent_commit_id`` stored on the runner).
* ``_ensure_turn_branch`` (worktree-branch management — requires
  ``self._worktrees()`` etc.).
* ``_mirror_session_to_base``, ``_stage_backend_resume``,
  ``_note_backend_session_change``, ``_should_continue_session``,
  ``_integrate_session_turn`` — runner-level coordination.

        """Core of every agent-commit path.

        Rebuilds the pending trace from *turns*, gates on ``has_staged_changes``,
        accumulates tokens, builds and records the commit.  Interactive
        differences (untracked review, branch preparation, message display) are
        fully injected so the same pipeline serves proxy-popup, proxy-quiet and
        actions/shell modes.

        Token usage is accumulated **only** once the commit actually happens
        (i.e. after ``has_staged_changes`` returns True).  A failed attempt
        (nothing staged) reprocesses the same turns on the next parse — the
        trace is rebuilt from scratch each call, but token usage is cumulative
        and would otherwise double-count.  (Bug #14, fixed in d041d10; both
        copies of the logic now share this single implementation.)

        Parameters
        ----------
        accumulate_trace_only_on_commit:
            When ``True`` (actions/shell mode), stage-check happens first and
            trace is only accumulated once the commit will definitely happen —
            leaving state pristine on a failed attempt so the caller can retry
            with fresh staging without a partial trace.  When ``False`` (proxy
            mode, the default), the trace is rebuilt before the stage check so
            the pending-user-merging logic can run even on failed attempts.
        backend_commits:
            Unintegrated commits the backend made itself this turn (full SHAs,
            oldest first), issue #35.  With nothing staged, the latest of them
            is amended to carry the trace/metadata; with staged changes, the
            normal commit lists them in its ``covered_commits`` metadata.

        Commits are created immediately, without any LLM call: summarization
        runs in the background afterwards and is attached by amending the
        commit message (issue #8) — blocking the commit on a summary froze the
        UI and delayed integration past the next turn.

        Returns ``True`` if a commit was made, ``False`` otherwise.
