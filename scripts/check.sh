# Single local gate that mirrors CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml), in the same order:

#   3. mypy vs the committed baseline (fails only on NEW errors)
#   4. tests + coverage

# Definition of "done" for a change: this script exits 0. Run it before you
# commit or push. It is also wired as a pre-push hook (see .pre-commit-config.yaml
# and the Contributing section of the README), so a push that would break CI is
# caught locally first.

#   uv run mypy | uv run mypy-baseline sync
