"""ProxyRunner._handle_pre_compaction: the /compact capture path.

The Summarizer class itself is covered in test_summarizer.py; these tests
exercise the proxy runner integration around it, which a try/except guards —
a bug there fails silently in production (the path once shipped constructing
the backend without its required repo argument and exporting via a
nonexistent attribute, so the capture never ran). The fake summarizer keeps
the real backend construction and real git notes in the loop so regressions
in either surface as assertion failures, not swallowed exceptions.

Since #8 the summarization runs on a worker thread so the UI never blocks:
_handle_pre_compaction only exports and spawns, and the result is applied by
_service_precompact_summary on the main loop.
