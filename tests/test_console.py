"""Tests for agitrack/console.py — the pre-TUI prompt helpers.

The point of these helpers is that a question asked after a long install is answered by a
deliberate keypress, and that a silent installer still looks alive. Nothing here touches a
real terminal: stdin/stdout are stubbed, so the drains are no-ops that must stay harmless.
